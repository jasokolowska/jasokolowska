# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Joanna, a passionate Software Engineer with a knack for Java and Angular. But wait, there's more to me than just code!

## About Me

I like to think of myself as a perpetual learner. Sure, my background might surprise youâ€” I'm a Chemical Engineer turned Code Ninja. Who says you can't mix chemicals and code, right? ðŸ˜‰ Despite my journey into the tech world, I've never lost my thirst for knowledge.

## âš¡ Fun Fact

Here's a fun fact about me: When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me buried in a good book or chasing after my little ones. I'm a proud mom of two, and let me tell you, juggling code and kids is my superpower. Some might see my age as a drawback, but I see it as an asset. Experience? Check. Wisdom? Double-check. Plus, who needs sleep when you have coffee, am I right?
